excerpt: 'Domain shift poses significant challenges in Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition (CD-FER) due to the changes in distributions between the source and target domains, including marginal and category distributions. Most existing methods focus on learning domain-invariant features through global feature adaptation, neglecting the potential benefits of transferable local features across different domains. In this study, we propose a Pseudo-Complementary Label Learning (PCLL) module and a Label Reweighting (LR) module to address this issue. Specifically, our approach leverages pseudo-labels and complementary labels to learn domain-invariant global and local features using credibility thresholds, selecting the best classification results to enhance cross-domain facial expression recognition.'
