excerpt: 'Domain shift in Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition (CD-FER) presents challenges due to distribution changes between source and target domains, including marginal and category distributions. Existing methods focus on domain-invariant features via global adaptation, overlooking the potential of transferable local features. We propose Pseudo-Complementary Label Learning (PCLL) and Label Reweighting (LR) modules. Our approach employs pseudo-labels and complementary labels for domain-invariant global and local features, enhancing cross-domain facial expression recognition.
Yet, category distribution differences persist between source and target domains. To tackle this, we introduce a metric quantifying learning difficulty for each category and match label weights to improve model performance on the target domain dataset. Extensive experiments on RAF-DB, FER2013, CK+, JAFFE, SFW2.0, and ExpW show our model's CD-FER performance enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.'
