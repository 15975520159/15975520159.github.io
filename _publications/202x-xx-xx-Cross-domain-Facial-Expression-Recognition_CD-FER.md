excerpt: 'To tackle this, we introduce a metric quantifying learning difficulty for each category and match label weights to improve model performance on the target domain dataset. Extensive experiments on RAF-DB, FER2013, CK+, JAFFE, SFW2.0, and ExpW show our model's CD-FER performance enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.'
