excerpt: 'This study addresses the lack of objective evaluation standards and data analysis methods for flat model poses, conducting research on professional model pose key point localization and quantitative analysis of dynamic values. The main content includes constructing a professional model pose dataset, proposing a stacked key point localization model, and automatic quantitative analysis of model pose key point dynamics. The dataset comprises aesthetically pleasing poses of various model stylings, defining 20 key points and their annotated dynamic values. The proposed key point localization model consists of stacked V-modules, incorporating attention mechanisms and intermediate supervision to enhance expressive capacity and localization accuracy. The model improves average precision and recall by 12.5% and 10.98%, respectively. For quantitative analysis of dynamic values, three different regression network models are designed. The multi-head supervised model with integrated prior knowledge performs optimally, achieving a 3.17% improvement in average precision and a 38.38% reduction in dynamic value mean squared error. The research findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively localizes model pose key points and automatically analyzes their dynamic values.'
