title: "Improving medication adherence through an integrated medication"
excerpt: "The project involves the use of 3D printing technology to create a pillbox that can serve as a phone case and has an integrated polarizing system. This allows the smartphone camera to capture the interior of the pillbox. Additionally, a companion app is developed, utilizing image detection technology to determine the quantity and types of pills inside the pillbox. The app sends email reminders to users to take medication on time. The schematic diagram is as follows:

In this project, I was responsible for the development of the companion app, integrating the YOLOv5s model as the underlying architecture and incorporating it into Android. Additionally, I handled the creation of the dataset and training of the model. It was my first time working on Android development, and although I encountered several challenges along the way, I managed to overcome them successfully. The app's performance is demonstrated as follows:
