title: "Localization and Automated Quantitative Analysis of Key Vein Points in Soybean Leaves for Fine Phenotype Analysis"
excerpt: "The project involves the cropping of scanned soybean leaf data to obtain individual and complete leaf images, forming the raw image dataset. In contrast to existing research that focuses only on intact leaves for vein extraction and analysis, there is also research value in studying damaged or diseased leaf samples. This dataset construction will include such soybean leaf samples. For the annotation tools and types, the image annotation tool CVAT is employed to annotate the dataset. Multiple key-point annotations are used to mark the main veins, while bounding boxes are used to label the leaves. Consideration is given to using multiple key-point annotations for secondary veins. The achieved results are as follows:
