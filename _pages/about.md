I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering, enrolled in the School of Mathematics and Information, as well as the School of Software at South China Agricultural University. My research interests encompass computer vision and machine learning. I consider myself fortunate to have the guidance of Professor Yuefang Gao from the School of Mathematics and Information, as well as the School of Software at South China Agricultural University. Professor Gao has provided me with valuable assistance along my academic journey, and I am grateful for her contributions to my growth.
